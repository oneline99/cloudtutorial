        "Python is a popular programming language created since 1991, widely used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "* web development (server-side) and software development,\n",
        "* mathematics, analytics and machine learning\n",
        "* system scripting\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What can Python do?**\n",
        "* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
        "* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
        "* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
        "* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
        "* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Python?**\n",
        "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
        "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
        "* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines comapared to other programming languages.\n",
        "* Python code can be executed as soon as it is written, meaning that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Fun Facts**\n",
        "* Cloud Coding is the brainchild of Charles Chong, and the initiative is supported by JC Kwon.\n",
        "* The intention is to enable non-developers to experience fun with coding, and allow students to continue to code on their own after the lessons via an online coding platform.\n",
        "* Google Colab enables interactive coding using Jupyter Notebook, which allows coding to be performed on both online and offline platforms. \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**\n",
        "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
        "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
